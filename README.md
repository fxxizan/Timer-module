# Scoreboard modules

A basic set of modules to make making your scoreboard easier. This isn't supposed to be some technical showoff or anything (I don't know how you would achieve that with just a few modules for setting the scorebord text) but rather more of a showcase of how you should write your code. This also includes an optimised timer solution that no other game in the ro-football genre has (that I've seen of) which can help with your bandwidth consumption (albeit it's minor). This is also my first project that I've generated with [Moonwave](https://eryn.io/moonwave/) so it's also taught me some bits as well haha
